Reply with a concise Chinese workflow cheatsheet only.

Include:
1. mode switching (`plan` vs editable, `Shift+Tab`)
2. `/manager -> /ship-step` loop
3. `/manager-team` for parallel tasks
4. common failures (`Not logged in`, wrong mode, scope too large)

Do not add implementation actions. This command is for reference only.
